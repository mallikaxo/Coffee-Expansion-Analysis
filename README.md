# ‚òï Coffee Sales Analytics SQL Project

This project provides a detailed analysis of coffee sales data across multiple cities, focusing on revenue, product performance, market potential, and customer engagement. The analysis is performed using **SQL (MySQL dialect used in the script)**, leveraging various features like joins, window functions, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to derive actionable insights.

The original SQL script outlines a complete process, starting with database setup and schema definition, followed by step-by-step data analysis queries across 15 steps.

## üìä Project Goals

The primary objectives of this analysis are to:

1.  **Summarize Company Performance:** Calculate total company revenue and analyze sales trends.
2.  **Evaluate City-Level Performance:** Break down revenue, average sale, and customer distribution by city.
3.  **Analyze Product Performance:** Identify top-selling products globally and for specific cities.
4.  **Assess Market Potential:** Compare actual customer numbers against estimated coffee consumers to gauge market penetration.
5.  **Track Growth:** Calculate monthly sales trends and month-over-month growth for each city.
6.  **Analyze Financial Ratios:** Compare sales-per-customer against estimated rent-per-customer for strategic insights.

## üìÅ Database Schema

The analysis is based on four inter-related tables:

| Table Name | Description | Key Columns |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `city` | Contains demographic and location-specific data. | `city_id`, `city_name`, `population`, `estimated_rent` |
| `customers` | Details about registered customers and their location. | `customer_id`, `customer_name`, `city_id` (FK) |
| `products` | Catalogue of coffee products and their prices. | `product_id`, `product_name`, `price` |
| `sales` | Transactional data for all sales. | `sales_id`, `sales_date`, `product_id` (FK), `customer_id` (FK), `total`, `rating` |

## ‚ú® Key Analysis Highlights

The SQL queries extract several critical insights, including:

* **City-Specific Bestsellers (Step 11):** Uses the `DENSE_RANK()` window function to determine the **Top 3 selling products per city**, crucial for localized inventory and marketing.
* **Monthly Sales Growth (Step 14):** Calculates **Month-over-Month (MoM) Growth Percentage** per city using the `LAG()` window function to monitor performance trends.

## üéØ Conclusion and Strategic City Recommendations

Based on the multi-dimensional analysis, the following table summarizes the key metrics for the top-performing cities‚Äî**Delhi, Jaipur, and Pune**‚Äîto inform strategic decisions regarding investment, expansion, or optimization.

| City | Key Strategic Strength (Recommendation Focus) | Supporting Market Potential Metrics | Supporting Financial & Growth Metrics | Recommendation Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Delhi** | **High Potential & Market Capture** (Focus on Deepening Penetration) | Highest **Estimated Coffee Consumers** ($12.4 \text{ million}$). Large current customer base ($68$ active customers). | Good penetration. **Significant growth** and stability in monthly trends. Average $\text{Rent/Customer}$ is $330$ (good $\text{Revenue vs. Rent}$ ratio). | **$$9.5/10$$** |
| **Jaipur** | **High Profitability & Efficiency** (Focus on Targeted Expansion) | High current customer base ($69$ active customers). Strong $\text{Actual Customers}$ to $\text{Estimated Consumers}$ ratio. | **Extremely Low Average $\text{Rent/Customer}$** ($156$). High **Average $\text{Sales/Customer}$** ($11.6 \text{k}$). Fluctuating but net-positive growth. | **$$9.0/10$$** |
| **Pune** | **High Value & Top Revenue Generator** (Focus on Revenue Optimization) | Strong current customer base. High $\text{Actual Customers}$ to $\text{Estimated Consumers}$ ratio. | **Highest Total Revenue**. **High Average $\text{Sales/Customer}$**. Very low Average $\text{Rent/Customer}$. Consistently **better growth** metrics. | **$$9.5/10$$** |
