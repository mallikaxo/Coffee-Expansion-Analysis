# ‚òï Coffee Sales Analytics SQL Project

This project provides a detailed analysis of coffee sales data across multiple cities, focusing on revenue, product performance, market potential, and customer engagement. The analysis is performed using **SQL (MySQL dialect used in the script)**, leveraging various features like joins, window functions, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to derive actionable insights.

The original SQL script outlines a complete process, starting with database setup and schema definition, followed by step-by-step data analysis queries across 15 stages.

The primary objectives of this analysis are to:

1. **Summarize Company Performance:** Calculate total company revenue and analyze sales trends.
2. **Evaluate City-Level Performance:** Break down revenue, average sale, and customer distribution by city.
3. **Analyze Product Performance:** Identify top-selling products globally and for specific cities.
4. **Assess Market Potential:** Compare actual customer numbers against estimated coffee consumers to gauge market penetration.
5. **Track Growth:** Calculate monthly sales trends and month-over-month growth for each city.
6. **Analyze Financial Ratios:** Compare sales-per-customer against estimated rent-per-customer for strategic insights.

| :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `city`      | Contains demographic and location-specific data.       | `city_id`, `city_name`, `population`, `estimated_rent`                             |
| `customers` | Details about registered customers and their location. | `customer_id`, `customer_name`, `city_id` (FK)                                     |
| `products`  | Catalogue of coffee products and their prices.         | `product_id`, `product_name`, `price`                                              |
| `sales`     | Transactional data for all sales.                      | `sales_id`, `sales_date`, `product_id` (FK), `customer_id` (FK), `total`, `rating` |

## ‚ú® Key Analysis Highlights

The SQL queries extract several critical insights, including:

* **City-Specific Bestsellers (Step 11):** Uses the `DENSE_RANK()` window function to determine the **Top 3 selling products per city**, crucial for localized inventory and marketing.
* **Monthly Sales Growth (Step 14):** Calculates **Month-over-Month (MoM) Growth Percentage** per city using the `LAG()` window function to monitor performance trends.
